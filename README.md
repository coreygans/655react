## Todo App for INF 655

This Todo app includes the following functionality:

*   Add, edit and delete tasks
*   Filter Tasks with quick filters
*   Add, edit and delete subtasks
*   Visibly see when a task is completed

Known issues

*   The “Is this a subtask” checkbox doesn't clear after adding a subtask. Confirmed that value is set to false but not visually representing it
*   Styling of subtask edit and delete icons are crowded and needs clean up
*   Filters work on parent tasks, but not on filtering subtasks. This needs to be revisited on best way to visualize this.
